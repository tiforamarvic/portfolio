  We're so glad you chose Codefoli for your website needs!
  
  Below are the instructions
  
  1. Run in the terminal in this directory, 'npm install'. 
  Be patient as this will take some time.
  
  2. Once you have done this, you can now run 'npm run dev' to see your app in a local environment, 
  or, run npm run build to compile into HTML, CSS and JS.
  
  3. If you have opted into running 'npm run build', you will see a new directory called 'dist'.
  Inside it will be an index.html, a css and js file. You can now deploy these files in whatever
  web hoster you prefer, and voila! Your brand new website!
